# Security Wall

<ItemImage id="nexus:security_wall" />

This block is non-breakable and non-blastable, it can be used to reinforce the ground beneath the *Nexus* or the walls of the bases to prevent players from simply digging their way to the *Nexus*. 

The block has no crafting recipe, so it must be set by the operators before the game begins.
