# Server Config Options

The **Nexus** mod is very adjustable, you can turn various features of the mod on and off in the server's config file. 

This file is created after you have started the server with the installed mod once. 

You can find it in your server directory under the path: __<Color id="dark_gray">world\serverconfig\nexus-server.toml</Color>__

You can open the file with many editors, but I recommend [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) 

The file contains all options with description. 

Remember that every time you change the file, you have to restart the server or reload the configs with a command.
